HEX PLANET USER GUIDE

Thank you for purchasing HexPlanet!
Operation is extremely simple and leaves tons of room for expansion and customization.  
Simply load the scene called Main located in the Scenes folder and click on the HexSphere gameobject in the inspector.
The detailLevel parameter allows you to specify the number of subdivisions, effectively setting the number of tiles on the planet.
This can range from 1 up to 4, producing a number of tiles between 42 and 2,562.  
The numColors parameter specifies the number of colors used to paint the tiles after theyre created.  You can specify the exact colors used within the Tile class.
This parameter was used for a previous game I made and likely wont be too useful for a broader range of applications, but it can be easily changed or omitted if you want.
Once youve specified a detailLevel, just make sure that the hexmat and pentmat material slots are assigned.  
Ive included a default flat color material for each as well as a cutout material for each which gives a transparent border around each tile.  This creates a cool look for space or abstract games.
Then hit play and look in awe at the procedurally generated hexplanet!

Ive included a simple camera script which lets you rotate around the planet with WASD or arrow keys and zoom in/out with the mouse scroll wheel.
Additionally there is a pointer script which controls the 3D cursor.  You can set the cursor status via an enum within the script.  This pointer status can be used to indicate if a an object under the mouse selection is busy or unselectable for example.
